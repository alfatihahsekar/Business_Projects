# Summary
This project aimed to perform RFM analysis on an e-commerce dataset to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. The analysis focused on identifying high-value customers, at-risk customers, and potential opportunities for personalized marketing campaigns. E-commerce companies want to segment customers. Marketing strategy will be determined according to these segments. The company listed sales between 2009 and 2011 to categorize customers. Additionally, RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis was performed to develop customer segments and optimize engagement strategies.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is the Online Retail II data set, which contains transactions from a UK-based, non-store online retailer between 01/12/2009 and 09/12/2011. The company primarily sells unique, all-occasion giftware, with many customers being wholesalers.

# Methodology

**Data Preparation & Cleaning**
The process was done on Google Colaboratory.

**RFM Calculation**
The process was done on Google Colaboratory.
1. Recency: Days since the customer's last purchase.
2. Frequency: Total number of purchases by the customer.
3. Monetary: Total amount spent by the customer.

**RFM Segmentation**
1. Segmented customers into different RFM categories using quintiles.
2. Assigned RFM scores to each customer based on their Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values.
3. Grouped customers into segments like "Champions", "Potential Loyalist", "At-Risk Customers", "Can't lost Customer", "Lost Customer", based on their RFM scores.

**Data Analysis & Visualization**
1. Created various visualizations to explore the distribution of RFM values among different customer segments.
2. Analyzed the retention rate of each segment to understand customer loyalty and engagement.
